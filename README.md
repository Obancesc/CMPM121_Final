# CMPM121_Final
This is my final assignment for my CMPM 121 class in UCSC. It is a test of animations and hack-n-slash combat.

The controls of the game/ demo are as follow: 
 - Use wither the W, A, S, D keys or the Arrowkeys to move around the plane.
 - To perform a swift horizontal attack press "I" key which is pressed twice in a row will perform a two-hit sequence.
 - To perform a lunge attack, press the "O" key.
